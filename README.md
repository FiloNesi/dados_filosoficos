# Emoji Warm-Up Games

Web app with four interactive mini-games designed as warm-up activities for English classes, specifically aimed at 5th and 6th grade Primary students. The goal is to activate language skills at the beginning of the lesson through short, engaging, and participatory tasks.

The entire application runs from a single HTML file, requiring no installation or internet connection.

## Included Games

**1. Emoji Dice Challenge**  
A random idea generator for sentence building. Includes three play modes: individual, pairs, or group work, using the cooperative learning structure "Think, Create, Share." Encourages creativity, teamwork, and active language production.

**2. This or That**  
A game of choices and argumentation. Students choose between two visual options and justify their choice. Ideal for practicing speaking structures like ‚ÄúI prefer‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚ÄúI like‚Ä¶ because‚Ä¶‚Äù.

**3. Secret Emoji Message**  
A cryptography-style game to practice the alphabet and spelling. Students decode hidden emoji messages or create their own for classmates to solve.

**4. Emoji Says**  
A digital version of "Simon Says" using emoji-based action prompts. Helps develop listening skills, action vocabulary, and TPR-style responses.
